To prove a goal of the form:

P → Q
  1. Assume P is true and then prove Q
     Form of final proof:
       Suppose P
         [Proof of Q goes here]
       Therefore P → Q

  2. Assume Q is false and prove that P is false (¬Q → ¬P)
     Form of final proof:
       Suppose ¬Q
         [Proof of ¬P goes here]
       Therefore P → Q
