ARGUMENTS

An argument is valid if the premises cannot all be true without the conclusion
being true as well.


BASIC LAWS

De Morgan's laws:
    ¬(P ∧ Q) is equivalent to ¬P ∨ ¬Q
    ¬(P ∨ Q) is equivalent to ¬P ∧ ¬Q

Commutative laws:
    P ∧ Q is equivalent to Q ∧ P
    P ∨ Q is equivalent to Q ∨ P

Associative laws:
    P ∧ (Q ∧ R) is equivalent to (P ∧ Q) ∧ R
    P ∨ (Q ∧ R) is equivalent to (P ∨ Q) ∧ R

Idempotent laws:
    P ∧ P is equivalent to P
    P ∨ P is equivalent to P

Distributive laws:
    P ∧ (Q ∨ R) is equivalent to (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)
    P ∨ (Q ∧ R) is equivalent to (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)

Absorption laws:
    P ∨ (P ∧ Q) is equivalent to P [read as 'satisfies P only or both P and Q']
    P ∧ (P ∨ Q) is equivalent to P [read as 'satisfies P or Q but always P']

Double negation law:
    ¬¬P is equivalent to P

Tautology laws (A tautology is always true):
    P ∧ (a tautology) is equivalent to P
    P ∨ (a tautology) is a tautology
    ¬(a tautology) is a contradiction

Contradiction laws (A contradiction is always false):
    P ∧ (a contradiction) is a contradiction
    P ∨ (a contradiction) is equivalent to P
    ¬(a contradiction) is a tautology


VARIABLES

Given a variable x, a statement S about x can be notated as S(x).
Eg; let P(x) stand for 'x is a prime number'


SETS

* A convenient notation for defining sets is as follows:
        B = {x | x is a prime number},
    read as;
        B is equal to the set of all x such that x is a prime number.

* When an element belongs to a set, the 'elementhood test' for the set defines a
  property of the element.
  Eg;
        y ∈ {x | x² < 9} means y² < 9
  NB:
        The above is a statement about y not x! y is a _free_ variable whereas x
        is a _bound_ variable.


TRUTH SETS

The truth set of a statement P(x) is the set of all values of x that make the
statement P(x) true. In other words, it is the set defined by using the
statement P(x) as an elementhood test: {x | P(x)}


UNIVERSE OF DISCOURSE (Like `concepts` in C++?)

When a statement contains free variables, it is often clear from context that
these variables stand for objects of a particular kind. The set of all objects
of this kind is called the universe of discourse. Variables are said to _range_
over the universe of discourse.

The universe of discourse, U of a set is notated as:
    {x ∈ U | P(x)}
read as;
    the set of all x in U such that P(x)


OPERATIONS ON SETS

The intersection of two sets A and B is the set A ∩ B defined as:
    A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

The union of two sets A and B is the set A ∪ B defined as:
    A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}

The difference of two sets A and B is the set A \ B defined as:
    A \ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}


NB: The logical connectives can only be used to combine statements, whereas the
set operations must be used to combine sets.


CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

Conditional statements take the form P → Q (If P then Q) where P is called the
antecedent and Q, the consequent.

P  |  Q  |  P → Q
-----------------
F     F     T
F     T     T
T     F     F
T     T     T

P → Q is equivalent to ¬P ∨ Q
P → Q is equivalent to ¬(P ∧ ¬Q)


CONVERSE AND CONTRAPOSITIVE

The converse of P → Q is Q → P. A conditional is not the same as its converse.

The contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, and according to the contrapositive law:
    P → Q is equivalent to ¬Q → ¬P


OTHER WAYS OF EXPRESSING THE CONDITIONAL

Given the conditional P → Q, this can be expressed as:
    P implies Q
    Q, if P
    P only if Q
    P is a sufficient condition for Q
    Q is a necessary condition for P


BICONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

Biconditional statements take the form P ↔ Q

P ↔ Q is equivalent to Q ↔ P

This is read P iff Q (P if and only if Q):
    P if Q because of the conditional Q → P
    P only if Q because of the conditional P → Q
